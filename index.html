        <p>Currently obsessed with Japanese literature. I like coffee (making it rather than drinking it) and corgi dogs.
        I also love to travel and have visited 12 countries so far (13 soon!)<br>If you are looking for a new book to read, please
        check the link below; it is one of my personal favourites.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>While I am not picky when eating canteen food, I am particularly picky when I eat out at restaurants. 
        I love <strong>taking pictures of my food</strong> and then judge its taste.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>My idea of a perfect day is reading a book while listening to music. I enjoy different genres, 
        but more particularly <strong>pop</strong> and <strong>indie</strong>. My current favourite song is
        <strong>summer</strong> by <strong>keshi</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Stationery</h2>
        <p>I love <strong>stationery</strong> and collectibles. If I were to open a business in the future, it would be related to stationery, 
        as I really enjoy pens, notebooks and stickers. When I have time, I do scrapbooking.</p>
